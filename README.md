Kiss Python IDE

A simple IDE for python developing. Developed under debian but should work on most linux distributions that ships 
python and gtk etc.  (which most are,).  A quick look on google showed that it *should* be able to get to run 
under windows aswell, though I will not look into that as I do not run that operating system. 

Kiss Python IDE is not ment to be a huge IDE as in eclipse.  If you want eclipse, use that.
Though some focus on being easy and simple it should handle the following.

* Projects.
* Git 


Kiss Python IDE will not handle other languages. Its not intended to code java, C, C++ etc. Will never be.
Kiss Python IDE is open source and licensed under GPL. It will never be closed source of any kind. Though, as with all
open source, it is always a nice gesture to donate money/hardware etc. As for money, just go ahead. When it comes to hardware,
I guess sending inside of sweden is ok. Otherwise, mind the environment and just send money instead. As to where: Just ask me on facebook
or mail.
