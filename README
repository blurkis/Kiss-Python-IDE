[Projects]

The IDE only handles projects.
That is, it is not possible to create/open only one specific file to edit.
It is, at the moment, only possible to open an existing project (which it self can off course be just one script)
or create a new project. 

To create a new project, just use File -> New project, File New Project from template and follow the
guides to get started. 


[Working with templates]

Some times it makes sense to have templates for python scripts. That is, for example: the basic for Gtk programming,
some basic classes you often use or just about anything. Some times, for example, it helps a beginner to get started
if the IDE has good defaults for templates. Getting started with python programming might be easier if most of the stuff is already 
there; only to let the beginner play with diffrent commands, or just changing values or whatever.
Well, templates is there.. I like it, so I wrote it. Thats about it. A good IDE for me, is mostly about making coding
easy and fast; and having sane defaults so the learningcurve is not to much of a mountain.
